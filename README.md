# Pizza-Sales

## Key recommendations 
1. Renegotiate wholesale prices for most used ingredients and consider taking the Brie Carre, containing 4 of the least used ingredients, of the menu.
2. Align staff allocation and preparation optimally with peak hours: Weekday lunch and Friday & Saturday Dinner

## Goal 
Analyze the sales data to improve overall business performance

## Methods
1. Clean and prepare the data by cleaning text.
2. Transform the ingredients listed in one column to a table to be able to analyze the quantity of ingredients used by splitting columns, pivoting, unpivoting and aggregating data.
3. Create relevant DAX measures such as revenue, average revenue, quanity used and average quantity used.
4. Prepare insighful data visualizations an create dashboard.
